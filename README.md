A motivated and driven individual with a keen eye for detail. With a commendable sporting background I am able to work well within a team but also lead if needs be. Having been in these high pressure environments I am able to adapt fast to be able to make a quick but calculated decision. I pride myself on being a people person, I thrive off communication with others and when relations aren't going well it's important to me to fix that, especially in the workplace.

#### Problem solving

- Throughout my time at Makers I have been problem solving, always striving to find the most efficient way to get through a problem. In order to do this I would have to be scrum master for a day, agreed by the rest of the team, so that there was no confusion with what we were doing

- Making the switch from twitter to using rails in our RPI-security-sensor project proved difficult, but I came up with the idea of using base64 so that we were able to store the images within a database (Postgresql), and then have an html page render the string.

## Christopher Barnett

A motivated and driven individual with a keen eye for detail. With a commendable sporting background I am able to work well within a team but also lead if needs be. Having been in these high pressure environments I am able to adapt fast to be able to make a quick but calculated decision. I pride myself on being a people person, I thrive off communication with others and when relations aren't going well it's important to me to fix that, especially in the workplace.
